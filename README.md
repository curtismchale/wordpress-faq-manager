## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What does this do? ###

It uses the custom post type feature to create a dedicated FAQ section in your WordPress site, including categories and tags exclusive to them.

### How Do I Use It? ###

Each FAQ acts like a "post". You can assign your own categories (called topics) or tags and organize as you see fit. You can also use shortcodes to place them on any page as follows:

* For the complete list:
	place `[faq]` on a post / page

* For a single FAQ:
	place `[faq faq_id="ID"]` on a post / page

* List all from a single FAQ topic category:
	place `[faq faq_topic="topic-slug"]` on a post / page

* List all from a single FAQ tag:
	place `[faq faq_tag="tag-slug"]` on a post / page

* List all from multiple FAQ tags:
	place [faq faq_tag="tag-slug-1, tag-slug-2"] on a post / page

* List all from both FAQ topcis and FAQ tags:
	place [faq faq_topic="topic-slug-1" faq_tag="tag-slug-2"] on a post / page

The list will show 10 FAQs based on your sorting (if none has been done, it will be in date order).
* To display only 5:
	place `[faq limit="5"]` on a post / page

* To display ALL:
	place `[faq limit="-1"]` on a post / page

* For a list with a title and link to full FAQ:
	place `[faqlist]` on a post / page

* For a list with a group of titles that link to complete content later in page:
	place `[faqcombo]` on a post / page

* For a list of taxonomies (topics or tags) with a link to their respective archive page:
	place `[faqtaxlist type="topics"]` or `[faqtaxlist type="tags"]` on a post / page

* For a list of taxonomies (topics or tags) with their description:
	place `[faqtaxlist type="topics (or tags)" desc="true"]` on a post / page
